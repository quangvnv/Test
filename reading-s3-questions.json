However, none of my school friends watched it. They missed this opportunity to see something interesting and educational because the programme didn’t appear in the TV Guide. This was a pity, as it was the type of programme that makes both young people and their parents think about things they don't normally consider. Why can't television companies let us know about such important documentaries in advance?\n\nThis programme was important because it showed how methods for helping people with toothache have developed over the centuries. If you think visiting the dentist today is an uncomfortable experience, just be grateful you didn't live 200 years ago! Then, the programme told us, the only cure for toothache was removing the tooth. There weren’t any dentists, so the person who cut your hair also pulled out your bad teeth, and there was nothing to stop you feeling the pain.\n\nThe programme has also completely changed my attitude to looking after my teeth. My parents were always saying to me things like, 'Don't eat too many sweets,' and, 'Brush your teeth after meals,’ but I never paid much attention. Now I've seen what damage sugar can do, especially if I don't use a toothbrush regularly. I'm going to change my habits. Many people would benefit from a repeat of this programme.",
